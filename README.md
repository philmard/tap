### 🎮 TAP

A fun and lighthearted React Native game where players compete to see who can tap their screen the most times!  

Featuring a global leaderboard 🏆, you can challenge friends and players worldwide to claim the top spot! 🏅  

> 💾 The game is powered by an **Appwrite database**, with user authentication and individual profiles to track each player's progress.  

> 🚀 To optimize performance, the local tap counter is managed using a **global state**, and the actual database counter is only updated **every 50 taps**, reducing server load while maintaining responsiveness.
